## v2.1.0-rc.3 - 2024-02-16

### Changed

- [Tim Riley] Compile a single directory of assets only (specified by arguments), instead of crawling the app
  structure to detect assets. The `--path` argument specifies the source directory of assets, and `--dest` specifies
  the directory to output the compiled assets and the manifest file. The `hanami assets` CLI commands will provide
  these arguments for each slice, so that each slice has its own separate compiled assets directory and manifest file.

- [Phil Arndt] Copy asset files from deeply nested directories.
